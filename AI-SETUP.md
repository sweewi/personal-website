# Setting Up an AI Assistant for Your Website

This document provides instructions on how to implement a fully functional AI assistant on your website that can answer questions about your projects, skills, and experience.

## Option 1: Using OpenAI's ChatGPT API (Production Solution)

For a custom AI that knows about you specifically, follow these steps:

1. **Create an OpenAI account** and get an API key at https://platform.openai.com/

2. **Prepare your training data** - Create a document with information about:
   - Your education and work history
   - Detailed descriptions of your projects
   - Your skills and expertise
   - Common questions people might ask about you

3. **Create an API integration** by adding the following to your project:
   - Install the OpenAI library: `npm install openai`
   - Create a secure backend to handle requests (to keep your API key private)
   - Connect your CustomAIChat component to this backend

4. **Sample backend code** (create a new file like `api/chat.js` on your server):

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Secure your API key in environment variables
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).end();
  }
  
  try {
    const { messages } = req.body;
    
    // Add system message with your custom context
    const fullMessages = [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `You are an AI assistant for William Sweeney, a web developer with expertise in React, Node.js, etc. 
                 William has worked on projects including [list your main projects]. 
                 William's education includes [your education details].
                 Answer questions about William's background, skills, projects, and experience.`
      },
      ...messages
    ];
    
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: fullMessages,
    });
    
    res.status(200).json({ 
      message: completion.choices[0].message.content 
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OpenAI API error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'An error occurred while processing your request.' });
  }
}
```

5. **Update your CustomAIChat component** to use this API.

## Option 2: Using Custom GPT (Simple Solution)

You can create a "Custom GPT" on ChatGPT with your personal data:

1. Login to ChatGPT (with a Plus subscription)
2. Click on "Explore" and then "Create a GPT"
3. Upload documents about yourself, your resume, project details, etc.
4. Configure it to specifically answer questions about you
5. Make it public and embed it on your website

## Option 3: Using Cloudflare Workers (Serverless Solution)

For a serverless implementation, create a Cloudflare Worker:

1. Set up a Cloudflare Workers account
2. Create a new worker that interfaces with the OpenAI API
3. Integrate with your frontend similar to Option 1

## Integration with Website

After implementing one of the above options, ensure:

1. Your AI chat interface is responsive and works well on mobile devices
2. Error handling is properly implemented
3. Loading states provide good user feedback
4. The AI has appropriate rate limiting to control costs
