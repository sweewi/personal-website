The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific image, you can use an online favicon generator or design your own. Once you have the image, save it as `favicon.ico` in the `/personal-website/personal-website/public/` directory.
